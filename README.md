# Audio Conversion Scripts
This repository contains two Python scripts to convert between .wav audio files and binary files.

## Files
wav_to_bytes.py: Converts a WAV file into a binary file.  
bytes_to_wav.py: Converts a binary file back into a WAV file.  

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:  
**(1)pydub**  
**(2)numpy**

## Usage
Please enter the input path of binary file: 
/path/to/output_audio.bin  
Please enter the output path of wav file: 
/path/to/output/

## Attention
Do not change the audio configurations (parameters) part, it has already been tested by Yujie and it works well.
